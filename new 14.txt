Inventory Reservation Service

Timeline: 5 hours or less

Description:

Build a Spring Boot microservice responsible for handling product inventory reservations. When a reservation request is received, the system must check stock availability, lock the required quantity, and mark the reservation as "PENDING."
A background processor should confirm or expire the reservation based on a configurable timeout. Concurrency control is essential—simultaneous reservation requests must not oversell stock. The service must include APIs for reservation creation, confirmation, and stock queries. All updates must occur within transactions.

Acceptance Criteria:

Create reservation API → sets status to PENDING.

Stock decreases only after reservation confirmation.

If insufficient stock → return validation error.

Prevent overselling using Optimistic/Pessimistic locking.

Scheduler expires old reservations and restores stock.

JWT authentication required for all stock operations.

SLF4J logs for reservation/confirmation/expiry events.
